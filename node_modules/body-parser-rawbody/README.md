# body-parser-rawbody

A clone of the original Node.js body parsing middleware that supports
the rawBody field inside the Request.

I will try to track every new release of the original body-parser but feel
free to add a pull request if I am being late.

Note: do not use this package unless you _really_ need it. This solution
is quite memory-inefficient.
